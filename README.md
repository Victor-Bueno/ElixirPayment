### About the project:
* This is a prototype of a bank API made with Elixir to improve my back-end skills

I used Elixir and Phoenix for the first time and while coding this project I learned a little more about:
* Docker
* Postgres
* Ecto
* Basic Auth
* Auto tests

And some concepts used in Elixir like:
* Pip operator
* Pattern Matching
* Migrations
* Fallback controller
